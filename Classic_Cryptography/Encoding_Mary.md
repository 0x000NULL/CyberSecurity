# Encoding - Mary Queen of Scots

## Overview
Codes have been used throughout history to keep messages secret.  One famous example is Mary Queen of Scots.  Students will learn about this famous code, use it to encode and decode messages, and finally create their own secret code using modern symbols (emojis).

## Purpose
Swapping letters or words for a symbol is one of the oldest methods of hiding information.  Sometimes letters are swapped for well-known standards for the purpose of transmitting (Morse code/Telegraph, ASCII - Binary/Computers) while other times the encoding is designed to keep the message secret.  

This activity will begin to build the idea of changing a message in order to send it.

### Objectives
Students will be able to:
- Encode a message using a defined code.
- Decode a message using a defined code.
- Create a new code and use it to communicate.
		
### Preparation
- [x] Print the [Symbol Cipher worksheet](Encoding/Symbol_Cipher.docx)

## Teaching Guide
### Getting Started
Discuss how encoding is used to swap a letter for another symbol.

### Activity
Symbol Cipher Worksheet
Have students work in pairs on the worksheet. Students will encode a message using the cipher used by Mary Queen of Scots

After encoding a message, they will swap with another group to decode their 
message.

Finally, students will create their own modern take on the cipher using emojis to replace letters or words.  As before, they will encode a message and swap with another group to decode a message.

### Wrap-up
Discussion:
If two people want to communicate secretly, what do they need?
	
Mary used a hollow bung in beer kegs to transport her messages.  Hiding in the open where people won't think to look is called Steganography.  What are methods you could use to send messages like this in your life?

What about digitally? Are there ways you could send these messages in the open where people wouldn't think to look in a digital form?
	
### Assessment Questions
- If you did not have a key, how could you begin to decode these a message encoded using a key like this?
- In a text document, I can change the font to WingDings or another symbol font.
- Is this a secure way of hiding information?
	- Why/why not?
	
### Extended Learning
