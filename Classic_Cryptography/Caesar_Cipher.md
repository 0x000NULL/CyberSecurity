# Caesar Cipher

TODO: Need Assessment Questions

## Overview
Students will explore encoding/decoding messages using the Caesar Cipher. Using a cipher wheel, messages will be encoded and decoded.

Purpose
The Caesar Cipher is one of the best known forms of encryption.  This signifies a change from encoding where a message was hidden with a set of substitutions for each letter to one where the only knowledge needed is a key to "unlock" the message.
	
### Objectives
#### Students will be able to:
- Encode/Decode a message using a Caesar Cipher and a known key
- Begin to decode messages where the key is unknown using cryptanalysis
		

### Preparation
- [x] Print the [Caesar Cipher wheel](Caesar_Cipher/Papercraft_Caesar_Wheel.docx) on cardstock
- [x] Get brad fasteners
- [x] Print [Caesar Cipher Worksheet](Caesar_Cipher_Activity.docx)

## Teaching Guide
### Getting Started
- Overview of Caesar Cipher (video)		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMOZf4GN3oc
	
### Activity:
Paper craft Caesar Cipher wheel
- Have students cut out and assemble the paper cipher wheel.
- Students will work through the encryption process on the worksheet.
- Students can engage with the CryptoClub Desert Oasis game.


### Wrap-up
#### Discussion:
1. How many possible keys are there in a Caesar Cipher?
1. What level of security does this provide us?  How difficult is it to break a message encrypted using the Caesar Cipher?

1. TED Talk: Why Privacy Matters https://www.ted.com/talks/alessandro_acquisti_why_privacy_matters?language=en

### Assessment Questions
- How have computers changed the security of a cipher like this one?
	
### Extended Learning
3D Printing: Print the Caesar Cipher ring to use instead of the paper wheel.

Python Programming: CaesarCipher.py
