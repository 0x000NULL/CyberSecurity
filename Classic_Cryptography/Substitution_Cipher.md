# Substitution Cipher

## Overview
Students will use a substitution cipher to encrypt a message and then to decrypt a message. In a substitution cipher each letter of the alphabet is swapped with a different letter.
	
## Purpose
Substitution ciphers are significantly more secure than a Caesar cipher but require a more complicated key. Look at the differences in complexity and portability of different ciphers.
	
### Objectives
#### Students will be able to:
- Encode and decode messages using a substitution cipher.
- Identify the mathematical advantage of substitution over shift cipher.
		
### Preparation
- [x] Print the [Substitution Cipher Activity Worksheet](Substitution_Cipher_Activity.docx)
- [x] Arduino Student Inventor Kit (Extended Activity)

### Vocabulary

## Teaching Guide
### Getting Started
Introduce the idea of a substitution cipher
- Each letter of our alphabet is swapped for that of a jumbled alphabet
- There are 26! different possible alphabets that could be used.
	
### Activity
- Substitution Cipher Activity Worksheet
- Students will encrypt and decrypt several messages using a substitution cipher.  
		
- They will then explore a keyword cipher and finally encrypt a message with a keyword to swap with someone else in the class.

### Wrap-up
#### Discussion
1. How is this type of cipher more secure than a shift cipher like Caesar?
1. What are the weaknesses of this cipher?
1. How does the random substitution compare to a keyword cipher?
	1. What are strengths/weaknesses of each?

### Assessment Questions
- How would frequency analysis be used to decrypt a message encrypted with a substitution cipher?
- Is there are way to change this encryption so it is not vulnerable to frequency analysis?
