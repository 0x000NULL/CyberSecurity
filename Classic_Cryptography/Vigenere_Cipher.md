# The Vigenère cipher

TODO: Need to make the python code scaffold a bit better.

## Overview
The Vigenère cipher is similar to the Caesar cipher but the key shifts between each letter.  This makes frequency analysis more difficult since the same letter in plaintext could be different letters in the cipher text.

## Purpose
To use a polyalphabetic cipher to encrypt and decrypt a message. Analyse the security of this cipher.  

### Objectives
#### Students will be able to:
- Use the Vigenère cipher to encrypt/decrypt a message.
- Explain how frequency analysis would work on this type of encryption.
- Identify possible weaknesses in the Vigenère cipher and how they might be exploited.

### Preparation
- [x] Print copies of The [Vigenère Square](Vigenere_Cipher/Vigenere_square.svg)
- [x] Print copies of The [Vigenère Activity Worksheet](Vigenere_Cipher/Vigenere_square_Activity.docx)

## Teaching Guide
### Getting Started
- Polyalphabetic Cipher(video)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgFJD7oCmDE

### Activity
- Have students encrypt/decrypt several messages using the Vigenère Square.
- While students are encrypting, they should be focusing on how patterns emerge and how they might be able to break this code if a keyword was unknown.

### Wrap-up
#### Discussion:
- How does this cipher make the code more secure?
- What are the primary limitations to this type of encryption?
