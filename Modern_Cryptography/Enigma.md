# Enigma Cipher

## Overview
Students will make a papercraft version of the German Enigma machine to better understand how the encryption worked.  Students will also look at the historical significance of Enigma and the people who worked to break the code.

## Purpose
The German Enigma is one of the first examples of mechanization of cryptography. The operation of the machine was sophisticated but the mathematics of the combinations of the rotors, plugs, and starting positions created a code that the Germans believed was "unbreakable"

### Objectives
#### Students will be able to:
- Encode/decode messages using the German Enigma
- Identify the historical context and important people in cracking the Enigma code.

### Preparation
- [x] Gather Pringles Cans
- [x] Print, Laminate, Cut Enigma Strips
- [x] Print copies of the Enigma Activity

### Activity:
- Explain the use and function of the Enigma Pringles can.  Decode and encode the messages in the worksheet.

### Wrap-up

### Discussion:
- Why was it so important to have a strong encryption on messages during this era?
- Why was the German Enigma so difficult to break?
- Can we use standard tools like frequency analysis?

### Assessment Questions
- Revisit the Vigenere Cipher, how was the Enigma different?
	- How was the Enigma similar to Vigenere?

- Knowing that enemies might have a version of the machine, why were the Germans still so confident in their design?
