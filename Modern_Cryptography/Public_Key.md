# Public Key Cryptography

Note: https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit4/7/ - this is it...
Need to make a python program for this RSA
Add a blog post about public key

## Overview
Students will learn about and practice public key encryption. Focus on asymmetric algorithms where the process is not the same in both directions.

## Purpose

### Objectives
#### Students will be able to:

### Preparation
- [x] Print CS Unplugged Activity
- [x] Signup for and enroll students in Code.org CSP course

### Links
