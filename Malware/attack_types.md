# Attack Types

## Overview
There are many ways that a hacking event occurs.  We will look at several known types and role-play how the attack is done.

## Purpose
Many attack types exist and are referred to by name.  We want to be able to define the different types of attacks and give them a real-world example to make the idea more concrete.
