1-10) Continuing Activities

1) Cryptography Overview
	- What is cryptography?
	- How was it used?
	- Suggested Reading (The Code Book)
	- Suggested Viewing (ComputerPhile or NumberPhile)

1a) Encoding vs. Encryption
	Differences between
	- Morse Code
		Activity to go along
	- Mary Queen of Scots
		Code in her method

	- Binary Numbers
		Activity to convert base 10 to binary
		Big Idea: All data is stored as 0s and 1s
	- ASCII and Unicode encodings
		Text can be stored as binary
		Letters are mapped to numbers on a list
	
		Coding example of letters to numbers
		Is there a built in Python method to convert decimal to binary?
		Check for those two things.
		Web examples of those.
	
2) Caesar Cipher
	- Background
	- Cipher Wheel (paper)
	- Cipher Ring (3D print)
	- Python code... either downloaded or on repl.it
		Make the classroom of unit 1 be importable on repl.it
		otherwise have the code downloadable
		
3) Substitution Cipher
	- Background
	- Suggested Reading: Chapter 1 of "The Code Book"
		- Mary Queen of Scots 
	- Keyword cipher
	- Random alphabet cipher
	
	- Advanced: Arduino Alphabet Generator
		Include Circuits.io version
		https://circuits.io/circuits/5157643-arduino-alphabet-generator/
		
	- Frequency Analysis
	- NSA Problem of the Week
	
4) Password Cipher
	- Same as a substitution cipher
	- Password used to begin alphabet
	- How secure is this?
		- What is the math behind the security?

5) Vigenere Cipher


6) Physical Ciphers
	- Rail Fence Cipher
	- Scytale Cipher
