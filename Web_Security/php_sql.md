# PHP and SQL

## Overview
In our last lesson we setup a SQL database, now we would like to access that information in the database on our website.  We will create sites using PHP that can display information found in a SQL database.

## Purpose
Modern websites use databases to store and manage information.  We want to better understand the framework that makes the connection between a webpage and a database possible.
